# Interview Round Scheduling Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive interview round scheduling functionality to the job posting system. Employers can now set up detailed interview rounds with descriptions, dates, and times, and candidates receive notifications about scheduled interviews.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Interview Round Types
The system supports 5 types of interview rounds:
- **Technical Round** - For technical assessments and coding challenges
- **Non-Technical Round** - For general aptitude and soft skills
- **Managerial Round** - For leadership and management discussions
- **Final Round** - For final decision making
- **HR Round** - For HR discussions and company culture

### 2. Interview Round Details
For each selected round type, employers can specify:
- **Description** - Detailed description of what the round involves
- **Date** - Scheduled date for the interview round
- **Time** - Scheduled time for the interview round

### 3. Database Schema Updates

#### Job Model (`models/Job.js`)
Added new fields:
```javascript
interviewRoundDetails: {
  technical: {
    description: { type: String },
    date: { type: Date },
    time: { type: String }
  },
  nonTechnical: {
    description: { type: String },
    date: { type: Date },
    time: { type: String }
  },
  managerial: {
    description: { type: String },
    date: { type: Date },
    time: { type: String }
  },
  final: {
    description: { type: String },
    date: { type: Date },
    time: { type: String }
  },
  hr: {
    description: { type: String },
    date: { type: Date },
    time: { type: String }
  }
},
interviewScheduled: { type: Boolean, default: false }
```

# Interview Notification System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The interview notification system now provides detailed interview schedules to candidates when they apply for jobs with pre-scheduled interview rounds.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Job Application Process
When candidates apply for jobs with scheduled interviews, they automatically receive detailed notifications containing:

- **Round Names**: Technical Round, HR Round, Managerial Round, etc.
- **Dates**: Specific interview dates

- **Descriptions**: Detailed information about each round

### 2. Candidate-Specific Notifications
- **Personal Notifications**: Each candidate receives their own notification when they apply

```javascript
candidateId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Candidate' }
```

#### Enhanced Query System:
- General notifications for all candidates
- Specific notifications for individual candidates
- Proper filtering based on candidate ID

### 4. Backend Implementation

```javascript
// When candidate applies for job with scheduled interviews
if (job.interviewScheduled && job.interviewRoundDetails) {
  // Create detailed notification with:
  // - Round names and descriptions
  // - Dates and times
  // - Professional formatting
}
```

#### Enhanced Notification Controller:
